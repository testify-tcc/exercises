# Testify

The Testify goal is to help developers learn about software testing in practice. We recommend using the platform along with Mauricio Aniche's book Effective Software Testing: A Developer's Guide, which is the base for the exercises.

# Exercises

This server holds the platform's exercise definitions. Its purpose is to define exercises in a easier and understandable way, so users can make suggestions via pull requests.

# Step by step to create an exercise
