# Tax calculator

On this exercise you already have a test, and you must write the
function `calculateTax(value: number)` that meet the following requirements:

- The input `value` must be greater than or equal to zero. In case it's not an error must be thrown with the message "Value cannot be negative".
- The tax is calculated using this logic: $(value \times 0.5) - 5$
- The output must also be greater than or equal to zero. In case it's not an error must be thrown with the message "Calculated tax value cannot be negative".

Taking a look on the test may help.
